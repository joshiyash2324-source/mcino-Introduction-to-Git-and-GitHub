# Simple Interest Calculator

## 📌 Project Description
This project contains a simple Bash script that calculates Simple Interest based on user input.

The formula used is:

SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

---

## 🛠 How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter:

- Principal amount (P)
- Rate of Interest (R)
- Time period in years (T)

It then calculates the Simple Interest using the formula and displays the result.
